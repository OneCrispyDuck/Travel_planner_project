This folder is for those who are also working on JavaScript but need a place to duplicate or test their code without affecting the main/official/final source-code.
This is also a place for you to create additional files/images/souce-codes like button features or A.I. etc
Just make sure you rename this folder later so you know the purpose of all it's contents.

Advise: NAME ALL OF YOUR DOCUMENTS/SCRIPTS SO WE ALL KNOW WHERE AND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CREATED OR ADDED INTO THE FOLDER.

TASK DISTRIBUTION:
Good'day PDF team, I've pushed a PDF flowchart to the GitHub repo - It's a general idea of what we might need to complete and generate the PDF form.
I've still got a few things to add, or if you also see that we need a few things to add to the flowchart you can too.
But overall that's it.

@Tyler you and me can handle the styling of the PDF document.

@ZED & @sinnia s1314695  I'll task you guys on some of the other parts of the JavaScript aspects, or if you fancy a specific part that's on the flow chart ~ be my guest to take it ðŸ™‚ 

PDF Styling: @Joseph  / @Tyler 
JavaScript: @Joseph  / @ZED  / @sinnia s1314695 

To the data processing team:
We are still figuring out what we will be utilizing to capture the user input data, it's likely to be some from of data-structure that will be called upon when generating the PDF.  Feel free to take a look at my flowchart too or any of my GitHub pushes ðŸ™‚
