1. User Input
   - Capture user input from a form in a separate HTML file.
   - Use event listeners to capture the form submission event and prevent the default form submission behavior.
   - Extract the user input from the form fields.

2. Data Storage
   - Consider using a database for storing a large amount of user input data. Options could be SQL (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (like MongoDB) databases depending on your data structure.
   - Alternatively, for temporary storage or less sensitive data, you can use browser-based storage like localStorage or sessionStorage.
   - Ensure data is sanitized and validated before storage to prevent security issues like SQL injection.

3. PDF Design
   - Use jsPDF library to generate the PDF.
   - Design the layout of the PDF using the methods provided by jsPDF. You can set the font, size, color, and position of the text.
   - Note: jsPDF does not support CSS. The layout needs to be designed using JavaScript and the methods provided by jsPDF.

4. PDF Generation
   - Retrieve the stored user data.
   - Use the jsPDF methods to add the user data to the PDF.
   - Save or download the PDF file.

5. Considerations
   - Error handling: Ensure your code can handle potential errors, such as missing user data or issues with generating the PDF.
   - Security: Sanitize and validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - Performance: If dealing with large amounts of data, consider performance. For example, you might need to implement pagination when retrieving data from the database.
   - Compatibility: Ensure the generated PDF is compatible with various PDF readers.
