This folder is for those who are also working on JavaScript but need a place to duplicate or test their code without affecting the main/official/final source-code.
This is also a place for you to create additional files/images/souce-codes like button features or A.I. etc
Just make sure you rename this folder later so you know the purpose of all it's contents.

Advise: NAME ALL OF YOUR DOCUMENTS/SCRIPTS SO WE ALL KNOW WHERE AND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CREATED OR ADDED INTO THE FOLDER.

As you will be working in pairs with a partner ~

THIS FORLDER IS FOR:
- your name
- your name
